# Equipped
# The Project
This is 2D multiplayer RPG based on a Zenva Lesson. I expanded on it by adapting parts of Brackey's RPG series. I adapted some of his code to work in 2D and expanded it to fit my needs. Through this, I was able to create an inventory system and character customization system.
